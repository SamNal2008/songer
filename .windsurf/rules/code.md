## Agent Instructions

Always use CLI to do something rather than writting file yourself : for boostraping the project, installing dependencies, check something in the code

After receiving instructions, split tasks into smaller tasks and create a MD file with the list of tasks.
Create a dependency tree of the task so multiple agents can run in parallele
Once its done check tasks done so everyone knows which task are remaining

Create atomics commits following semantic commit like : feat, fix, chore, doc, test
Each commit should containining a full working applications
